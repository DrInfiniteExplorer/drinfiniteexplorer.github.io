I've written a tool to adjust bed-level-data easier.

In my previous post I wrote about building Marling FW with bed leveling. Since then I've done a lot of test-prints, and realized that it is kinda hard to do properly.

So I wrote a simple tool to adjust and iterate on the mesh easier. It is available on github in the [Level_Adjust](https://github.com/DrInfiniteExplorer/adjust_bed)-repository.
