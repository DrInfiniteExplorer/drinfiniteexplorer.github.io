You did it. You found my site.

Welcome!

I'm going to use this to blog and write about things when it strikes my fancy.

So uh, who am I? My name is Pierre LeMoine. I think most of my friends would say that I'm kind of a nerd?

Not the pop culture fanboy type of nerd. The kind that reads the OpenGL specification for fun.

Some people think I'm a tea connoisseur. But little do they know, I just like drinking copious amounts of tea.
